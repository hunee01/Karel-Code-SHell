# Karel-Code-SHell
A toy command line shell based off Bash.
Made with very minimal C experience, and on CodeHS, hence the name!

All required scripts currently contained in the karel folder (excluding the config folder).
Type 'help' for the list internally defined commands.

Any reported bugs would be greatly appreciated.
This is a beginner project, and I'll be glad to increase my skills through improvement.
