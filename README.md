# Karel-Code-SHell
**A toy command line shell based off Bash.**<br/>
Made with very minimal C experience, and on CodeHS, hence the name!<br/>
<br/>
All required scripts contained in the `karel` folder.<br/>
Type `'help'` for the list internally defined commands.<br/>
<br/>
Any reported bugs would be **greatly appreciated**.<br/>
This is a beginner project, and I'll be glad to increase my skills through improvement.<br/>
<br/>
<sub>A 'mens et manus' project</sub><br/>
